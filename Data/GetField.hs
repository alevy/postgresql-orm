-- | Functions to extract a field of a particular type from a

-- constructor (not variant types).

-- An example of usage:
--
-- > data MyType = MyType { myString :: String             -- position 0
-- >                      , myInt :: Int                   -- position 1

-- >                      , myMaybeChar :: Maybe Char      -- position 3
-- >                      , myMaybeString :: Maybe String  -- position 4
-- >                      } deriving (Show, Generic)
-- > 
-- > myType :: MyType
-- > myType = MyType "my type" 21 True Nothing (Just "maybe string")

-- | Dirty trick to construct "less specific" overlapping instances by
-- making a class argument a simple type variable, but constraining
-- that variable to be a particular type.  E.g., neither of the
-- following two instances is more specific than the other, because
-- @NO@ is not more general than @YES@:
--
-- > class MyClass a b c | a b -> c where myClass :: a -> b -> c ()
-- > instance MyClass a a YES       where myClass _ _ = YES ()
-- > instance MyClass a b NO        where myClass _ _ = NO ()
--
-- Hence, attempting to use the first instance will generate a
-- compilation error rather than inferring the type of c as YES.  On
-- the other hand, of the following two instances, the first is more
-- specific than the second:
--
-- > instance MyClass a a YES where
-- >     myClass _ _ = YES ()
-- > instance (TypeGCast NO c) => MyClass a b c where
-- >     myClass _ _ = typeGCast $ NO ()
--
-- That's because @c@ is more general than @YES@.  The key to this
-- working is that an instance context--i.e., @(TypeGCast NO c)@--is
-- never consulted during instance selection, only to validate an
-- already-selected most-specific instance.
--
-- Note that @YES@ and @NO@ in these examples have kind @* -> *@.
-- Hence the @G@ in @TypeGCast@.  The same trick is equally applicable
-- to types of kind @*@, we just don't happen to need that in this
-- module.

-- | Class of types used as tag arguments to 'gGetFieldVal' and
-- 'gGetFieldPos'.  @f@ should be a new unit type of kind @* -> *@,
-- used to designate the type of extraction you want.  Then instances
-- should be defined to transform each type @a@ you want to extract to
-- some type @r@, with @g@ set to 'THasOne'.
--
-- For example, 'ExtractMaybe' is a type to convert types @a@ and
-- @Maybe a@ both to type @Maybe a@ (i.e., type argument @r@ is @Maybe
-- a@).

-- > instance Extractor ExtractMaybe a b THasZero where  -- Incorrect
-- >   extract _ = THasNone
--
-- (Except the above wouldn't quite work anyway given the rules for
-- overlapping instances.)  So just assume that any instance you don't
-- explicitly define for your 'Extractor' will automatically fall back
-- to 'THasNone'.
